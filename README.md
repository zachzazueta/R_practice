## Practice with R

This is a simple data manipulation project to practice some basics in R.

I start with a wide data set about LEGO sets and pair it down into something more managable. Some of the cleaning steps include pivoting, string replacement, cleaning of regex and developing a set of summary statistics.

I then begin to explore the data and do lite statistical analysis and visualizations.
